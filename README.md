# maze-js
Maze Generators in JavaScript. The code come from [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers), originally written in Ruby, and ported to JavaScript and slightly modified to reflect my own idea.

## Prerequisites
You will need [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) installed. If it's not installed in your system, install it first.

    $ npm install gulp -g

## Setup
Clone the project and install the dependencies.

    $ git clone https://github.com/ntalbs/maze-js.git
    $ cd maze-js
    $ npm install

## Running the maze
Run `gulp`:

    $ gulp

This will build the project and show the result in your default browser.
